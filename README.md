## What is Docker?

Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software.

Docker accomplishes this using a UNIX technology called **containers**.

Historically:

- Unix-style operating systems have used the term _jail_ to describe a modified runtime environment for a program that prevents that program from accessing protected resources.
- Since 2005, after the release of Sun's Solaris 10 and Solaris Containters, _container_ has become the preferred term for such a runtime environment.
- The goal has expanded from preventing access to protected resources to isolating a program from all resources except when explicitly allowed.

Any software run with Docker is run inside a container.
